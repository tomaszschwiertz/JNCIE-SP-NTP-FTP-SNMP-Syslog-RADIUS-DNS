TACACS+ on Ubuntu 14

sudo apt-get install tacacs+

//show us the location of the configuration file and if the process is running
root@base:~# ps -ef | grep tac_plus
root     17490     1  0 01:34 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/tac_plus -C /etc/tacacs+/tac_plus.conf

//back-up the original file to refer back to if there is any issues
sudo cp /etc/tacacs+/tac_plus.conf /etc/tacacs+/tac_plus.conf.old
//we will use a simpler config file

//Accounting
//Firstly we’ll need to set the file that the accounting information will be written to.
//By default this is /var/log/tac_plus.acct, however you can have this file where you like if you don’t want you use the default file and path.

//You have to create this file yourself. This can be done by running the command:
sudo touch /var/log/tac_plus.acct

//the file is referenced in the tac_plus.conf already (you just need to create it)
*accounting file = /var/log/tac_plus.acct*


//Secret Key
//The Server and Client need to have a matching key so the AAA packets can be encrypted.
//This key can be anything you wish however, if you’re going to have a key with white-space, key-words, or special characters,
//you’ll need to use quotation marks

//the key is referenced in the tac_plus.conf already (you just need to change it)
*key = testing123*


//Users
//You’ll need to define the users that will have access to the device.
//Each user needs to be associated to a group and have their password defined.
//The password has to be set as either a MD5 or DES hash. By using tac_pwd use can get your hashed output:
root@base:/var/log# tac_pwd
Password to be encrypted: lab123
MWArlmIgREP6s

//There is an additional stanza service = junos-exec that defines an additional group.
//This is Juniper specific and I’ll explain this later. I created two users:
//tschwiertz; will have permission to do anything and second user
//test; that will only have Read-Only access.
//Both have the same password (generated from tac_pwd. Usernames ARE case sensitive.

# We also can define local users and specify a file where data is stored.
# That file may be filled using tac_pwd
user = tschwiertz {
    name = "Tomasz Schwiertz"
    member = admin
    login = des MWArlmIgREP6s
		service = junos-exec {
			local-user-name = remote-admin
	}
}

user = test {
    name = "Test User"
    member = read-only
    login =  des MWArlmIgREP6s
        service = junos-exec {
            local-user-name = remote-read-only
               }
}

//the above goes into the tac_plus file


//Groups
//As you can guess, groups are where you define the level of access and what commands will be used by the group.
//The commands, for my example, are used to define actions that are largely accepted by most vendors with the expectation of Juniper
//(from my knowledge but correct me if I’m wrong), although I wont be confirming the configuration works in this post.
//I have checked with a Cisco device and they worked as expected.

//We have a few parameters that are important remember:
//default service: defines the default permission that the user will have. By default, if this statement isn’t used or left blank, it’s denied.
//Meaning that each permitted command users of this group will have to be listed. If you want the default permission to allow, then the
//statement permit is needed


//service: define services which the group is authorised to execute, these could be commands that the group is authorised to execute.
//Authorisation must be configured on both the client and the daemon to operate correctly.

//cmd: This is where you list a command and set an action, it will be either be a permit or deny.
//Additionally by having the .* this means that any command after the first word is affected. i.e my example below, all
//show commands will be permitted

//In my example I have two groups, admin and read-only, the admin group will have full access permitted and the read-only group,
//as the name suggests, will have read-only access and will be denied from any configuration, clear or restart commands.

# We can also specify rules valid per group of users.
group = admin {
	default service = permit
	service = exec {
		priv-lvl = 15
		}
	}

group = read-only {
	service = exec {
		priv-lvl = 15
		}
	cmd = show {
		permit .*
		}
	cmd = write {
		permit term
		}
	cmd = dir {
		permit .*
		}
	cmd = admin {
		permit .*
		}
	cmd = terminal {
		permit .*
		}
	cmd = more {
		permit .*
		}
	cmd = exit {
		permit .*
		}
	cmd = logout {
		permit .*
		}
}

//the above goes into the tac_plus file

//verify if the configuration is correct:
service tacacs_plus check
...
 * Checking TACACS+ authentication daemon configuration files successful tacacs+ //nice!
 
//Additional commands that will be useful to remember:
service tacacs_plus check
service tacacs_plus status
service tacacs_plus stop
service tacacs_plus start
service tacacs_plus restart

//there’s a Juniper Specific stanza in tac_plus.conf file
//When authenticating users against a TACACS+ server on juniper devices and you’ll need to apply
//Juniper Networks Vendor-Specific TACACS+ Attributes.
https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/user-access/topics/topic-map/user-access-tacacs-authentication.html#id-juniper-networks-vendor-specific-tacacs-attributes

//These attributes can be either:

//1). Specified in the tac_plus.conf file by using regular expressions to list all the commands that the user has permitted or denied.
//A user will need to be created on the device (JunosOS) with that user (xxx) being referred under the local-user-name statement.
//The stanza would look something:

service = junos-exec {
	local-user-name = xxx
	allow-commands =  .*
	allow-configurations = .*
	deny-commands = 
	deny-configuration = 
	user-permissions = 
	}

	
//the above goes into the tac_plus file

//2). Configure a class that has states all the permitted or denied permissions, this class will be linked to a user.
//Both need to be configured on the device (JunosOS). Once this has been created you’ll need to refer, said user, under the local-user-name

[sample config from junos device]

//The Junos OS retrieves these attributes through an authorization request of the TACACS+ server after authenticating a user.
//For my example, I went with the latter. Now we’ll jump onto the SRX220 and get that sorted with TACACS+ AAA configuration.


//Juniper Configuration
//single-connection: this means that instead of multiple TCP sessions connecting to the device from a server, a single session is maintained between them
//best practice: an authentication order should be set so that if there was an issue or loss of connectivity to the TACACS+ server,
//you’ll be able to fall back to locally defined users.
//source-address: what address will be used by JunosOS to communicate with TACACS+ Server

authentication-order [ tacplus password ]; //What happens now is the system tries to authenticate the user using TACACS+, and if denied - then moves on to the local database  This obviously succeeds.

We don’t really want to leave it like this
tacplus-server {
    10.1.0.148 {
        secret "$9$iHfz9Cu1Eyp0yKWxwsZUjHP5z36AuO"; ## SECRET-DATA //testing123
        single-connection;
        source-address 10.1.0.158;
    }
}

//With the TACACS+ server we’re able log different events that take place on the device and get those commands sent to the server.
//From my experience the accounting events that you would most want logged are logins, configuration changes and interactive commands.
//This is set under system accounting stanza

accounting {
    events [ login change-log interactive-commands ];
    destination {
        tacplus;
    }
}

//Next, under the system login stanza, you need to create a class that has a list of permission available to the user(s)
//that are going to be associated to it. The user(s) are what are used in the tac_plus.conf file.
//In my example I created two classes, one with all permission super-user-local and the other user with read-only and
//basic troubleshooting options (ie ping, traceroute, telnet etc) read-only-user-local. These associated this classes
//with 2 users remote-admin and remote-read-only

login {
    class read-only-user-local {
        permissions [ network view view-configuration ];
    }
    class super-user-local {
        permissions all;
    }
    user remote-admin {
        full-name "TACACS User";
        uid 2009;
        class super-user-local;
    }
    user remote-read-only {
        full-name "TACACS read-only user";
        uid 2011;
        class read-only-user-local;
    }
}


//verification
//As you can see below I had no problem with user tschwiertz. However, when I logged in with the "test" user I wasn’t able to
//enter the configuration mode as the permission wasn’t granted, and for that user the command isn’t even recognized.
//I ran a show command and you will see that none of the passwords are shown. Again this is due to the permission level granted.
